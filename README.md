## JAVA 2CP TPS

We had 8 TPs and a mini project (Highest mark with 19.5/20) under the module named ["OOP"](https://www.esi-sba.dz/fr/index.php/course/programmation-orientee-objet/) in the second semester of my second year preparatory cycle in the Higher national school of computer sciene [ESI SBA](https://www.esi-sba.dz/fr/) where we deep dived into oriented object programing concepts using Java, you can check all the tps solutions.

*PS: there are TPs that can be executed directly (first ones), in other hands the advanced ones I was working with netbeans/eclipse.*

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

* `src`: the folder to maintain sources
* `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
